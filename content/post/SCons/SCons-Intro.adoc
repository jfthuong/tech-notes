== Purpose

*SCons* is a tool equivalent to Makefile (but better). It is configured by simple Python code.

From the authors:
[quote, scons.org]
____
SCons is an Open Source software construction toolâ€”that is, a next-generation build tool.
Think of SCons as an improved, cross-platform substitute for the classic Make
utility with integrated functionality similar to autoconf/automake
nd compiler caches such as ccache. In short, SCons is an easier,
more reliable and faster way to build software.
____

== Features

It is working best with *C/C++* language but can also works out of the box with:

* Java
* Latex (to PDF)
* DocBook
* Archives (tar, zip)
* Text files
* etc.

The list of builders can be found http://scons.org/pages/download.html[here] and
the list of tools it uses can be found http://scons.org/doc/HTML/scons-user.html#app-tools[here].

Additionally, any command can easily be added via the
http://scons.org/doc/HTML/scons-user.html#chap-builders-commands[Command] Builder.

Some of the highlights of this tool:

* Configuration files are Python scripts--use the power of a real programming language to solve build problems.
* Reliable, automatic dependency analysis built-in for C, C++ and Fortran
* Built-in support for C, C++, D, Java, Fortran, Yacc, Lex, Qt and SWIG, and building TeX and LaTeX documents.
* Easily extensible through user-defined Builders for other languages or file types.
* Reliable detection of build changes using MD5 signatures; optional, configurable support for traditional timestamps.
* Integrated Autoconf-like support for finding #include files, libraries, functions and typedefs.
* Global view of all dependencies

== Installation

On Windows:

1. Install *Python*
2. Download Windows installer from: http://scons.org/pages/download.html
3. Run the installer
4. Check SCons has been installed successfully: `scons --version`

NOTE: Although `pip` can find `scons`, it cannot install it. What a pity!

WARNING: SCons is not (yet) compatible with Python 3.x

Another way to install SCons is to build from the sources.

1. Download the sources (*.zip* or *.tar.gz*)
2. Unzip somewhere and open a command line in that directory
3. Install with Python: `python setup.py install`
4. Check the installation: `scons --version`

If you have an issue with installation, please check FAQ.

== A small example

The source file:

.hello.c
[source,c]
include::{include_dir}/hello.c[]

The building program (which is using Python syntax):

.SConstruct
[source]
Program('hello.c')

The command to run (without the prompt `$`):
----
$ scons
----

And that's it: this will create the program built from _hello.c_.

For information, it will display the following on the console:
----
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
cc -o hello.o -c hello.c
cc -o hello hello.o
scons: done building targets.
----

And if you want to do a clean-up, *SCons* will automatically decide what needs to be done.
You just need to call with `-c` option (or `--clean` if you prefer).
----
$ scons -c
----

== FAQ

=== "Command not found" when running `scons`

First, install *SCons* with `python setup.py install` method.

Then, go to your Python installation directory
and put either of the following files in subfolder *Scripts*:

* `scons.bat` if you run scons from *cmd*
* `scons` if you run scons from *Msys* or *Cygwin*

.<Python_dir>/Scripts/scons.bat
[source, bat, linenums]
----
include::{include_dir}/scons.bat[]
----

.<Python_dir>/Scripts/scons
[source, shell, linenums]
----
include::{include_dir}/scons[]
----
