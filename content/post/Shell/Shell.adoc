== Shell commands

=== Operations on arguments

Checking if an argument has been defined:

[source]
----
if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
    # No argument found
else
    # At least one argument
fi
----

Parsing from the 2nd argument:

[source]
----
if [ "$1" == "clean" ]; then
    clean=1
    args="${@:2}"
else
    clean=0
    args="$@"
fi
